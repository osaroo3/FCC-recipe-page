            Jollof (/dʒəˈlɒf/), or jollof rice, is a rice dish from West Africa. The dish is typically made with
            long-grain rice, tomatoes, chilis, onions, spices, and sometimes other vegetables and/or meat in a single
            pot,
            although its ingredients and preparation methods vary across different regions. The dish originated in
            Senegal.[3]

            Regional variations are a source of competition among the countries of West Africa, and in particular
            between
            Nigeria and Ghana, over whose version is the best; in the 2010s this developed into a friendly rivalry known
            as the "Jollof Wars".

            In French-speaking West Africa, a variation of the dish is known as riz au gras. The Senegalese version,
            thieboudienne, has been recognized by UNESCO as an intangible cultural heritage dish.

            <h2>History and origin</h2>
            The Jolof or Wolof Empire was a confederacy state that ruled parts of West Africa situated in modern-day
            Senegal, Mali, The Gambia and Mauritania from around the 12th century[4][5][6] and was later known as the
            Jolof Kingdom. According to African food historian Fran Osseo-Asare, the origins of jollof rice can be
            traced to the area, where rice was grown;[2] the original dish was known as thieboudienne or thiebou
            djeun,[7] and contains rice, fish, shellfish and vegetables.[8] If made with meat, it is called ceebu
            yapp.[2] The fishing communities of Saint-Louis are considered the birthplace of thieboudienne.[9][10][11
